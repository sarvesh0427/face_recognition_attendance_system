# **Face Recognition Using Python and Excel Integration**  

This project demonstrates a **face recognition system** developed using **Python, OpenCV**, and the **face_recognition** package. The system utilizes an **Excel file** (managed using the **openpyxl** library) as a simple database to store and update user details and face recognition results.

## **Features**  

âœ… **Face Recognition**: Uses the `face_recognition` package to detect and recognize faces from a live camera feed or stored images.  
âœ… **OpenCV Integration**: Handles computer vision tasks such as capturing images and displaying results.  
âœ… **Excel File as Database**: Two Excel files are used:  
   - **Users.xlsx**: Stores user details (e.g., name, ID, and face encoding).  
   - **Attendance.xlsx**: Tracks attendance based on recognized faces.  
âœ… **Automated Updates**: The system automatically updates the Excel files when a face is recognized or new data is registered.
